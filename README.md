This project is the result of the Front-end Development course. 
React+vite was used for the frontend server. 
For the backend, node.js is used. 
This project uses PostgreSQL to store data. 
For correct operation, you need to update the data in the .env and db.js files, except (possibly) the corresponding port values with your own.
